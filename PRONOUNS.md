Pronouns are words that stand in for or replace nouns. There are nine categories of pronouns:

Subject Pronouns
Objective Pronouns
Indefinite Pronouns
Relative Pronouns
Demonstrative Pronouns
Possessive Pronouns
Interrogative Pronouns
Reflexive Pronouns
Intensive Pronouns
Subject pronouns include I, you, he, she, it, we, and they. As their name implies, subject pronouns always function as subjects of a sentence.

Number	Person	Case (subjective)
Singular	1st	I
2nd	You
3rd	She 
He 
It
Plural	1st	We
2nd	You
3rd	They

This category of subject pronouns is a closed category. In other words, the pronouns listed are the complete set. No changes or additions exist.

Singular indefinite pronouns use singular verbs. Plural indefinite pronouns use plural verbs.
