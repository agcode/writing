CONJUNCTIONS
Conjunctions are words that link other words in a sentence and indicate the relationship between those words. There are four types of conjunctions:

coordinating conjunctions
correlative conjunctions
adverbial conjunctions
subordinating conjunctions

You will study conjunctions again in Week 4 when you study the different types of clauses. But for now, learn the four types of conjunctions as subcategories of one of the eight parts of speech.

Coordinating conjunctions join words or word groups of equal importance.

There are only seven coordinating conjunctions: 
*Use the memory word FANBOYS to help you remember all seven coordinating conjunctions.

For
And
Nor
But
Or
Yet
So
Examples

The child was crying, for he had fallen and scraped both knees.
The man and the woman walked hand in hand down the street.
The Tanâ€™s did not wish to visit Alaska, nor did they wish to visit Tierra del Fuego.
She likes tea but not coffee.
The student could play or study, but not both.
The young man ate breakfast, yet he was still hungry.
The game ended, so the team left the field.
Correlative conjunctions are word pairs that join words or words groups of equal importance.

Common correlative conjunctions include:

not only . . . but also
whether . . . or
both . . . and
not . . . but
either . . . or
as . . . as
neither . . . nor
Examples

They want to travel not only to Europe but also to Asia.
I want either the red dress or the black shoes.
I want both the red dress and the black shoes.
Whether you clean your room or vacuum the house is up to you.
Unlike coordinating conjunctions and correlative conjunctions that link words and word groups, adverbial conjunctions join independent clauses, which you will study in Unit 4.

Adverbial conjunctions tell the reader the relationship between the two main clauses. Below are common adverbial conjunctions organized by the relationship they specify.

Addition	- in addition furthermore moreover further
Emphasis	- in fact indeed
Comparison or Contrast	- however nevertheless nonetheless otherwise in contrast in comparison
Cause or Effect	- as a result consequently hence therefore thus
Time - finally meanwhile next


Subordinating conjunctions are a word or group of words that introduces a subordinate clause, which you will study in Unit 4.

Below are common subordinating conjunctions organized by the relationship they specify.

Cause or Effect	- as because since
Concession	- though although even though even if
Condition	- if since unless when whenever
Comparison or Contrast	- while as rather than
Purpose	- in order that so that
Space or Time - before since once after while when until

Study these charts, for you will be referring to them throughout the course. You should become familiar with these words and the corresponding organizational relationship. They will help you to improve your thought and sentences as you write.
