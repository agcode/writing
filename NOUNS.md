In reading through the lists of nouns, you noticed that some of the nouns are capitalized and others are not. In addition to being a person, place, thing, living creature, or concept, nouns can be common and proper. Common nouns are not capitalized. Proper nouns are capitalized.

So while the nouns adult, country, pastry, dog, and disease are common nouns, the nouns Mother Teresa, Latvia, Buche de Noel, Basenji, and Ebola are all proper nouns.
