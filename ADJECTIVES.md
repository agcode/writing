Adjectives are words you use to modify a noun or a pronoun. In this section you will learn about three categories of adjectives: (1) descriptive adjectives, (2) proper adjectives, and (3) predicate adjectives.

A descriptive adjective describes a quality of the noun the adjective modifies.

large house
frigid night
wide gorge
purple plum
green truck
blissful sleep
A proper adjective is formed by using a proper noun or formed from a proper noun.

French pastry
Shakespearian play
Jeffersonian democracy
African dance
Predicate adjectives follow the noun and are connected to the noun by a linking verb, which you will learn about in the next module. In the following examples, the predicate adjective follows the highlighted linking verb:

She seems brave.
The bread is stale.
He looks bored.
The trash smells unpleasant.
The three articles in English, a, an, and the (sometimes referred to as determiners) always function as adjectives in a sentence.
