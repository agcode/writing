SUBJECTS
All sentences must have an actor, the “who or what” a sentence is about. The subject in a sentence is that actor. Most of the time, you can find the subject/actor of a sentence somewhere near the beginning of a sentence. The subject/actor is also usually in front of the verb in the sentence. To locate a subject/actor, ask yourself who or what the sentence is about.

Margie walked to the store.

If you ask who this sentence is about, the answer is Margie. So the subject of this sentence is Margie.

Also, if you can find the verb in a sentence, you can ask who is doing the action the verb describes. For this sentence, ask who is walking to the store. Again, the answer is Margie.

Finally, the subject, Margie, is close to the front of the sentence, and it comes before the verb.

Nouns make great subjects in sentences, but they are not the only words that can work as subjects. Subjects can also come from other parts of speech and word combinations. The list below identifies the parts of speech and word forms that provide us with sentence subjects.

Nouns (part of speech)
Trains are still a popular form of transport.
Books lined the back wall.
Pronouns (part of speech)
She left the building at closing time.
They often gather in the courtyard.
The “understood” subject (you, a pronoun, is the “understood” subject)
Please, go to the store.
Bring me a glass of tea.
Gerunds (formed by adding –ing to a verb: swimming, driving, learning, jogging, writing)
Swimming provides cardiovascular exercise.
Driving in Los Angeles can be very dangerous.
Learning is inspirational.
Infinitives (the preposition to + a verb: to swim, to drive, to learn, to exercise, to agree)
To swim is always a choice.
To drive can be quite nerve-wracking.
To learn is a challenge I enjoy.
Nouns:

As you recall from Unit 2, the part of speech called nouns encompasses thousands of words used to name persons, places, things, living creatures, and ideas.

Because nouns identify the persons, places, things, living creatures, and ideas in our environment, this part of speech often provides subjects for sentences. Nouns do an excellent job of acting out the answer to the "who/what question" used to identify the subject of a sentence.

Pronouns:

Pronouns, which you studied in Unit 2, can also act as subjects because they stand in for nouns. The types of pronouns that can function as subjects include personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.

Personal Pronoun	We quickly ate the caramel gelato.
Demonstrative Pronoun	Those are the shoes from the store.
Interrogative Pronoun	Who told you that story?
Indefinite Pronoun	Everyone enjoys writing well.

Another type of pronoun, the relative pronoun, can function as a subject in subordinate clauses, which you will study in the next unit, Unit 4.

Personal pronouns have distinct characteristics, including number, person, gender, and case. They also have the characteristic of being part of a closed group. In other words, no changes or additions will be made to this group. The pronouns I, you, he, she, it, we, and they are all of the personal pronouns that act as subjects.

Number: This term simply means singular (I, he, she) or plural (we, they). In other words, if the noun being represented is singular, choose a singular pronoun. If the noun(s) being represented is plural, choose a plural pronoun.
Person: This term refers to your point of view. You use 1st person when you are speaking (I, we); you use 2nd person when you are speaking directly to the reader (you); you use 3rd person when you are speaking about someone or something else (he, she, it, they).
Gender: This term identifies whether the pronoun represents a subject that is male (he), female (she), or neuter (it).
Case: This term refers to the two distinct case classifications of personal pronouns. Case determines how the pronoun is to be used. Subjective case means that the pronoun can be used as a subject in a sentence. Objective case means the pronoun can be used as a direct object or other object field.
The following table identifies personal pronouns that can substitute for nouns as subjects in sentences and how to choose the appropriate pronoun form:

Number	Person	Gender	Case (Subjective)
Singular	1st	Female/Male	I
2nd	Female/Male	You
3rd	Female	She
Male	He
Neuter	It
Plural	1st	Female/Male	We
2nd	Female/Male	You
3rd	Female/Male/Neuter	They
This category of subjective personal pronouns is a closed category. In other words, the pronouns listed in the table are the complete set. There will be no changes or additions.

The sentences below use personal pronouns as subjects.

Singular

I ate the last piece of pizza.
You are a very fast runner.
She left a book in my car.
He bought a hamburger.
It had begun to rain.
Plural

We always work together.
You get bonuses every month.
They joined the choir.
You can also use demonstrative pronouns as subjects in sentences. The next table identifies and describes how to use demonstrative pronouns as subjects. Demonstrative pronouns have only two characteristics: (1) they represent number (one item or more than one item), and (2) they describe whether these items are near in distance or time OR far in distance or time.

Demonstrative Pronouns that can be used as Subjects
Number	Near in Distance or Time	Far in Distance or Time
Singular	This	That
Plural	These	Those
This category of demonstrative pronouns is a closed category. In other words, the ones listed are the complete set. There will be no changes or additions.

The sentences below use demonstrative pronouns as subjects.

This is the best place to park.
These are the figs and pistachios that are on sale.
That really got to me.
Those fell off the truck.
Possessive pronouns are pronouns used to refer to subjects in sentences that are a specific person/people or thing/things belonging to a person/people (and sometimes to an animal(s) or thing(s)). These pronouns have three characteristics: number, person, and gender. In addition, possessive pronouns can be used as subjects and/or objects.

Possessive Pronouns that can be used as Subjects
Number	Person	Gender of Owner	Possessive Pronouns
Singular	1st	Female/Male	My/Mine
2nd	Female/Male	Your/Yours
3rd	Female	Her/Hers
Male	His
Neuter 	Its 
Plural	1st	Female/Male	Our/Ours
2nd	Female/Male	Your/Yours
3rd	Female/Male/Neuter	Their/Theirs
This category of possessive pronouns is a closed category. In other words, the ones listed are the complete set. There will be no changes or additions.

Singular

Mine is the last scone on the table.
Yours was left in the car.
Hers came with the card attached.
His was a mighty blow.
Plural

Ours describe ways others might interpret art.
Yours were the last to arrive.
Theirs won first place.
Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions. These pronouns represent the person or item that isn’t known (who or what the question is asking about). Interrogative pronouns can stand in for subjects.

Interrogative Pronouns that can be used as Subjects
If the Subject is a	Use the pronoun
Person	Who
Thing	What
Person/thing	Which
Person	Whose
This category of interrogative pronouns is a closed category. In other words, the ones listed are the complete set. There will be no changes or additions.

The sentences below use interrogative pronouns as subjects.

Who borrowed my pencil?
What will happen tomorrow?
Which seems to be the most popular?
Whose is the red blanket?
Indefinite pronouns complete the list of pronouns that can act as subjects in sentences. Indefinite pronouns have really only two characteristics that need to be considered when using them as subjects; they can be singular or plural (or both depending on the context in which they are used) since they share the characteristic of number. The concept of singularity or plurality is important because the number of the pronoun determines the number of the verb you will use. Singular indefinite pronouns use singular verbs. Plural indefinite pronouns use plural verbs.

Indefinite pronouns that end in –one are always singular. These words include anyone, everyone, someone, and one.
Indefinite pronouns that end in -body are always singular. These words include anybody, somebody, and nobody.
Indefinite pronouns like both, many, others, and several are always plural.
Indefinite pronouns like any, more, most, and some can be singular or plural, depending on how they are used.
Indefinite Pronouns that can be used as Subjects

This category of indefinite pronouns is a closed category. In other words, the indefinite pronouns listed are the complete set. There will be no changes or additions.

The “Understood You”: The “Understood You” occurs when you give a command or order to someone or suggest something to someone. These sentences are unique in that the subjects of these sentences are not written. Instead, the subject is said to be an “understood subject.” Consider the following sentences:

Go to your room.
Drink the rest of your milk.
Wash your hands and face, please.
As you can see, there is no written subject for these sentences. Ask yourself, “Who is this about?” and “Who is the actor?” The answer has to be to whomever the sentence is directed. The most obvious answer is “You.”

You go to your room.
You drink the rest of your milk.
You wash your hands and face, please.
When you compare the two sets of sentences, you can see that you do not need to write the subjects because the pronoun, you, is understood as the actor in each one.

GERUNDS:

A gerund is a word formed by adding the suffix –ing to a verb. Words that are formed in this way usually represent activities—either physical or mental. Examples include running, eating, thinking, wishing, and herding. Gerunds act like nouns, and nouns are the most common kind of sentence subjects. Therefore, gerunds can act as subjects, too. Consider the following sentences.

Running the Inca Trail near Machu Picchu can be arduous.
Eating keeps my body fueled.
Thinking critically is a way to exercise the brain.
Wishing won’t get you anywhere.
Herding cattle on the Pampas of Argentina can be hard work.
To determine the subjects for these sentences, ask, “’Who or what’ are these sentences about?” The answers come easily. These sentences are about running, eating, thinking, wishing, and herding.

INFINITIVES:

Like gerunds, infinitives are also made by using verbs. Infinitives are composed of the preposition to + verb. Infinitives represent future or abstract activities that have not yet happened. The following examples may help to clarify this:

To fly over the Andes was his dream.
To enter the Basílica de la Sagrada Familia in Barcelona would require a long wait in line.
To learn a second language is her main goal.
To wait in the rain and wind seemed silly.
The first two examples are actual representations that may happen in the future. The last two examples are abstract ideas that also have not yet happened. And just like with gerunds, simply ask the “who or what” question to determine the subject. For example, “Who or what was his dream?” “Who or what would require a long wait in line?” "Who or what is her main goal?” “Who or what seemed silly?”
