PUNCTUATION
   Commas    Apostrophes    Semicolons

After your sentences are edited for agreement and parallel structure, you will read your paragraph looking specifically for punctuation. Since you have already finalized all the content of your paragraph (topic, topic sentence, details, concluding sentence) and crafted your writing style, you will re-read your paragraph a few more times. This time, you will only be looking for punctuation. Many students even read their work backwards, one sentence at a time, so as not to skip over words or punctuation. Other students will touch the tip of their pen or pencil to each word and punctuation mark to carefully consider each mark on the paper.

For this course, you will study three types of punctuation:

Commas
Apostrophes
Semicolons
Commas

You will remember from Unit 4 that commas are used in a variety of ways when punctuating clauses, phrases, and the four sentence types. A common mistake you may have been taught about commas is that if there is a pause, you need to insert a comma. Instead, if you understand how commas work in sentences, then you can think through whether or not you need a comma.

There are many rules for commas, but for this course, you will study a few rules that will help you the most at this stage. When you reread your paragraph, look closely at each comma to see if it fits into one of the following categories.

Commas with Introductory Elements

Use a comma after a word, phrase, or subordinate clause that precedes the main clause.

Finally, the antelope gave up and succumbed to the superior strength of the lion.
Humming softly to herself, Wilhelmina explored every inch of the hardware store.
Although he appeared innocent at first, the man’s story began to break down under the scrutiny of the detective’s questions.
Commas in a Series

Use a comma in between items in a series. In formal academic writing, the last comma is usually preferred.

Would you like one, two, or three scoops?
Clarence’s special trail mix contained peanuts, chili peppers, malt balls, and dried apricots.
Her analysis of the story argued that Leticia was actually confused upon first meeting Oscar, Mary herself benefited from the purloined letter, and the outcome of the story was comic rather than tragic.
Commas with Coordinating Conjunctions

As you will remember from Unit 4, use a comma after the first clause and before the coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence.

My favorite band is coming to town, so I will be camping out to get a ticket.
An assortment of visitors appeared at the gate, but the ambassador never acknowledged them.
Comma Splices and Fused Sentences

A comma splice is an error that occurs when you join two independent clauses with a comma. Instead, use a coordinating conjunction, period, semicolon, or a semicolon and adverbial conjunction.

Comma Splice: The last time we saw him was in December, you won’t believe how much he has changed since then.
Correct: The last time we saw him was in December, but you won’t believe how much he has changed since then.
Correct: The last time we saw him was in December. You won’t believe how much he has changed since then.
Correct: The last time we saw him was in December; you won’t believe how much he has changed since then.
Correct: The last time we saw him was in December; however, you won’t believe how much he has changed since then.
Closely related to a comma splice is the fused sentence. This occurs when a writer joins two independent clauses with no punctuation. You fix a fused sentence the same way as you do a comma splice. Here is an example, using the same sentence above, of a fused sentence:

Fused Sentence: The last time we saw him was in December you can’t believe how much he changed since then.
You would correct a fused sentence in the same way that you correct a comma splice.

When you can recognize independent clauses in your writing, you will begin to eliminate comma splices and fused sentences. Study Unit 4 again if you feel like you need some additional review.

Subordination

As you studied in Unit 4, when a subordinate clause appears at the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after the subordinate clause. However, if the subordinate clause appears at the end, you will usually omit the comma. You may remember this example:

Because it might rain, I will bring an umbrella to the festival. (comma)
I will bring an umbrella to the festival because it might rain. (no comma)
Subordination is yet another way to fix a comma splice or a fused sentence. Look at this example:

Comma Splice: The last time we saw him was in December, you can’t believe how much he changed since then.
Corrected with Subordination: Although we just saw him in December, you can’t believe how much he has changed since then.
Apostrophes

Apostrophes are used to show possession or to mark a contraction. You can learn how to think through whether an apostrophe is correct by analyzing each apostrophe in your writing. You can focus on two types:

Possessive apostrophe: We found Hank’s hammer. (Instead of the awkward phrase “the hammer of Hank,” write “Hank’s hammer.”)
Contraction: I can’t make it. (In this sentence, “cannot” has been shortened to “can’t”)
Since most academic and formal writing does not allow for contractions, possessive apostrophes will be your focus. The rules are relatively simple.

Use an apostrophe followed by “s” with a singular noun to mark possession:

The keeper filled the tiger’s bowl with water.
The spider sucked the juice out of the aphid’s paralyzed body.
Use an apostrophe with a plural noun to mark possession:

The keeper filled the tigers’ bowls with water.
The wind knocked the birds’ nest out of the tree.
The Exception: It

Possession will be marked for every noun with an -'s or -s'. Also, nearly all pronouns have their own possessive cases--for example, yours, his, hers, theirs--so you will never use an apostrophe with pronouns, including it. However, to mark it as possessive, simply add an s.

The tree fell because of its own weight.
The wind blew its way into the house.
The bicycle had lost its fender.
Many students will attempt to mark the possessive of “it” with an apostrophe and “s.” However, “it’s” is a contraction for “it is.” This is simply an exception to remember:

Its = Possessive
It’s = Contraction for “It is”
You can use apostrophes a few other ways, but for now, concentrate on correctly marking nouns possessive.

Semicolons

As you learned in Unit 4, semicolons can join two complete sentences. Also, as you studied in the section on commas above, a semicolon can fix a comma splice. Semicolons act like a period in some cases, like a comma in others.

When a semicolon joins two independent clauses, use it like a period:

Mark found the new route easy; the other climbers were impressed.
The balloon floated up to the ceiling; the baby cried.
Even though you can use semicolons like a period, you should use them sparingly, usually with an adverbial conjunction:

The new law goes into effect today; therefore, you can no longer turn right on a red light between 4 and 6 p.m.
You can also use semicolons in between items in a series when those items have commas.

An unidentified flying object was spotted in Roswell, New Mexico; Amarillo, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Paducah, Kentucky.
He disliked ice cream, cookies, and cake; horror movies, cherub statues, and violins; and sleeping, playing dominoes, and counting on his fingers.
